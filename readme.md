# On Air Tic Tac Toe

## How to run

Run `yarn` followed by `yarn dev` to start the dev server. <br />
If you use npm, run `npm -i` followed by `npm run dev`.

## Good to know

- The project runs on Vite.
- The design is responsive.
- The game has various grid sizes. I capped it at 5 to keep the UI usable, but the code knows no limit.
- There is an AI, so you can play Tic Tac Toe on your own.
- There is some basic testing which ensures that the game itself works.
